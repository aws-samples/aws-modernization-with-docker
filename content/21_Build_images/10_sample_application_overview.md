## Sample Application Overview

The application that we will use for this module is made up of a Flask application with a backend that runs a MYSQL database which all runs on a webserver created by NGINX. The source code for our sample application is located on GitHub. Login to your GitHub account, and clone the repo: https://github.com/anshrma/docker-compose-ecs-sample. and change into directory with all the code we will be using in this module. 

```
$ git clone https://github.com/anshrma/docker-compose-ecs-sample
```
```
cd ~/environment/docker-compose-ecs-sample
```

If you were able to follow the directions above your Cloud9 file directory should look like the following:
