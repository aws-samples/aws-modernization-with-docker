## **Docker Build Local: Overview**

Docker Build Local is the traditional method of building container images directly on your machine. This approach uses your local Docker Engine to execute all build steps, process instructions in your Dockerfile, and create the final image, all without requiring external services or paid subscriptions.

### **Key Advantages**

- **Free to use**: No subscription required
- **Works offline**: Build without internet connectivity
- **Full privacy**: Code never leaves your machine
- **Complete control**: Direct access to the entire build process
- **Immediate feedback**: Real-time build output and error messages

## **Workshop Example Project**

This workshop uses the [Rent-A-Room](https://github.com/aws-samples/Rent-A-Room) repository as our example application. This is a React-based project using `react-scripts` for building and running the frontend.

## **Choose Your Build Method**

Select which Docker build approach you'd like to use:

- **[Continue with Docker Build Local](./36_Docker_Build_Local/)** - The traditional approach using your local machine resources (free, works offline)
- **[Switch to Docker Build Cloud](../36_Docker_Build_Cloud/)** - The cloud-based approach for faster builds (requires paid subscription or using free trial)

The next section will guide you through the Docker Build Local workflow.
