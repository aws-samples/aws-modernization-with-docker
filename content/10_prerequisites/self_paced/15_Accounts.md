**Note**: If you encounter errors during the deployment, ensure that:  

1. You have sufficient permissions to deploy CloudFormation stacks.
2. Your AWS account has the required service limits for the resources being deployed.  
3. All parameters are correctly configured as per the workshop requirements.  

If you have any issues, refer to the troubleshooting section or contact the support team.
