Your Cloud9 environment comes prebuilt with a version of Docker that doesn't have the features that we will need for this workshop. Please follow the steps below to install and verify that you have the correct version

1. Open the terminal on Cloud9 and run the following: 

```
sudo apt  install jq -y
curl -L -o docker-linux-amd64.tar.gz https://github.com/docker/compose-cli/releases/download/v1.0.10/docker-linux-amd64.tar.gz
tar xzf docker-linux-amd64.tar.gz
chmod +x docker/docker
which docker
sudo ln -s $(which docker) /usr/local/bin/com.docker.cli
./docker/docker --context default ps
sudo mv docker/docker /usr/local/bin/docker
docker version
docker compose

```

You should receive results as follows
