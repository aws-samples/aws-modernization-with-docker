# Application Modernization with AWS and Docker

![Docker] (/images/docker-cloud-twitter-card.png)

### Welcome!

In this workshop you will learn how to build and deploy applications with Docker and Amazon ECS using the new Docker Compose CLI tool developed in partnership with AWS and Docker. We will also learn about modernization best practices like how to secure secrets, CI/CD, and deploying our application using serverless containers on AWS Fargate. 

Docker is an open platform for developing, shipping, and running applications. Docker enables you to separate your applications from your infrastructure so you can deliver software quickly. With Docker, you can manage your infrastructure in the same ways you manage your applications. By taking advantage of Dockerâ€™s methodologies for shipping, testing, and deploying code quickly, you can significantly reduce the delay between writing code and running it in production.

### Learning Objectives
- Deploy an application using the Docker Compose ECS Integration
- Build your own image using Docker Buildkit and how to deploy that image to Amazon ECS.
- Container security using AWS Secrets Manager
- CI/CD using the Amazon ECS plugin for GitHub Actions
- Serverless Containers using AWS Fargate 

## Who should take this workshop?
- Developers 
- DevOps Engineers
- Solutions Architects
- Site Reliability Engineers (SRE's)
- Anyone that loves containers and wants to learn more!
