# üîÑ Understanding the CI/CD Pipeline Configuration

Now that we've set up the GitHub connection and deployed our CloudFormation template, let's understand how our CI/CD pipeline is configured to integrate Docker Build Cloud, Docker Scout, and Amazon ECS deployment.

## üìã Pipeline Architecture Overview

Our CloudFormation template creates a complete CI/CD pipeline with these key components:

![pipeline-architecture](/images/complete-pipeline.png)

1. **Source Stage**: Pulls code from your GitHub repository
2. **Build Stage**: Uses Docker Build Cloud for efficient container image building
3. **Security Scan Stage**: Integrates Docker Scout for vulnerability assessment
4. **Deploy Stage**: Deploys the application to Amazon ECS

## üîç Key Components in the CloudFormation Template

Let's examine the key components in our CloudFormation template that power our pipeline:

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Docker Build Cloud Integration

The template includes a CodeBuild project specifically configured to use Docker Build Cloud:

```
# CodeBuild Project for Docker Build
DockerBuildProject:
  Type: AWS::CodeBuild::Project
  Properties:
    Name: docker-build-cloud-project
    Description: "Build Docker image using Docker Build Cloud and push to Docker Hub"
    ServiceRole: !GetAtt CodeBuildServiceRole.Arn
    Artifacts:
      Type: CODEPIPELINE
    Environment:
      Type: ARM_CONTAINER
      ComputeType: BUILD_GENERAL1_SMALL
      Image: aws/codebuild/amazonlinux2-aarch64-standard:2.0
      PrivilegedMode: true
    Source:
      Type: CODEPIPELINE
      BuildSpec: |
        version: 0.2

        env:
          secrets-manager:
            DOCKER_USERNAME: "dockerhub-credentials:DOCKER_USERNAME"
            DOCKER_TOKEN: "dockerhub-credentials:DOCKER_TOKEN"

        phases:
          pre_build:
            commands:
              - echo Logging in to Docker Hub...
              - echo $DOCKER_TOKEN | docker login -u $DOCKER_USERNAME --password-stdin
              - echo Setting up Docker Buildx...
              - docker version
              - mkdir -p ~/.docker/cli-plugins/
              - curl -SL https://github.com/docker/buildx/releases/download/v0.10.4/buildx-v0.10.4.linux-arm64 -o ~/.docker/cli-plugins/docker-buildx
              - chmod +x ~/.docker/cli-plugins/docker-buildx
              - docker buildx version
              - docker buildx create --name mybuilder --driver docker-container
              - docker buildx use mybuilder
              - docker buildx inspect --bootstrap
              - COMMIT_HASH=$(echo $CODEBUILD_RESOLVED_SOURCE_VERSION | cut -c 1-7)
              - IMAGE_TAG=${COMMIT_HASH:=latest}

          build:
            commands:
              - echo Building Docker image using BuildKit...
              - docker buildx build --platform linux/arm64 -t $DOCKER_USERNAME/rent-a-room:latest -t $DOCKER_USERNAME/rent-a-room:$IMAGE_TAG --push .

          post_build:
            commands:
              - echo Docker image pushed to Docker Hub
              - echo Writing image definitions file...
              - echo '[{"name":"rent-a-room","imageUri":"'$DOCKER_USERNAME/rent-a-room:$IMAGE_TAG'"}]' > imagedefinitions.json

        artifacts:
          files:
            - imagedefinitions.json
```

#### üîπ Key Elements of the Docker Build Configuration

| Element                    | Description                                    | Benefit                                            |
| -------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| **ARM_CONTAINER**          | Uses ARM-based build environment               | Optimized for building ARM64 images                |
| **PrivilegedMode: true**   | Enables Docker-in-Docker capabilities          | Required for Docker Buildx                         |
| **docker buildx**          | Sets up Docker's multi-architecture build tool | Enables advanced build features                    |
| **--platform linux/arm64** | Specifies target architecture                  | Ensures compatibility with ARM-based ECS instances |
| **--push**                 | Pushes directly to registry                    | Streamlines the build and push process             |

#### üîπ Multi-Architecture Build Capabilities

While our current pipeline is configured specifically for ARM64 to match our ECS task definition, Docker Build Cloud supports multi-architecture builds. With a simple modification, you could build for multiple architectures simultaneously:

```
# Example of multi-architecture build command
docker buildx build --platform linux/amd64,linux/arm64 -t $DOCKER_USERNAME/rent-a-room:latest --push .
```

This capability allows you to:

- Build once, deploy anywhere
- Support both x86 (AMD64) and ARM-based (ARM64) environments
- Optimize for AWS Graviton processors while maintaining compatibility with traditional instances
- Automatically serve the right image architecture to different environments

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Docker Scout Security Integration

The template includes a dedicated CodeBuild project for Docker Scout security scanning:

```
# CodeBuild Project for Docker Scout Security Scan

            DOCKER_USERNAME: "dockerhub-credentials:DOCKER_USERNAME"
            DOCKER_TOKEN: "dockerhub-credentials:DOCKER_TOKEN"

        phases:
          pre_build:
            commands:
              - echo Logging in to Docker Hub...
              - echo $DOCKER_TOKEN | docker login -u $DOCKER_USERNAME --password-stdin
              - COMMIT_HASH=$(echo $CODEBUILD_RESOLVED_SOURCE_VERSION | cut -c 1-7)
              - IMAGE_TAG=${COMMIT_HASH:=latest}

          build:
            commands:
              - echo Running Docker Scout security scan...
              - docker pull $DOCKER_USERNAME/rent-a-room:$IMAGE_TAG
              # Run Docker Scout with security gates
              - >
                docker run --rm
                -e DOCKER_SCOUT_HUB_USER=$DOCKER_USERNAME
                -e DOCKER_SCOUT_HUB_PASSWORD=$DOCKER_TOKEN
                docker/scout-cli cves $DOCKER_USERNAME/rent-a-room:$IMAGE_TAG --exit-code --only-severity critical,high
              - echo "No critical or high vulnerabilities found. Scan passed!"
              - >
                docker run --rm
                -e DOCKER_SCOUT_HUB_USER=$DOCKER_USERNAME
                -e DOCKER_SCOUT_HUB_PASSWORD=$DOCKER_TOKEN
                docker/scout-cli recommendations $DOCKER_USERNAME/rent-a-room:$IMAGE_TAG

          post_build:
            commands:
              - echo Security scan completed
              - echo Generating security report...
              - >
                docker run --rm
                -e DOCKER_SCOUT_HUB_USER=$DOCKER_USERNAME
                -e DOCKER_SCOUT_HUB_PASSWORD=$DOCKER_TOKEN
                docker/scout-cli cves $DOCKER_USERNAME/rent-a-room:$IMAGE_TAG --format json > security-report.json
              - echo "Creating imagedefinitions.json file"
              - echo '[{"name":"rent-a-room","imageUri":"'$DOCKER_USERNAME/rent-a-room:$IMAGE_TAG'"}]' > imagedefinitions.json

        artifacts:
          files:
            - security-report.json
            - imagedefinitions.json
```

#### üîπ Key Elements of the Docker Scout Integration

| Element                                       | Description                          | Benefit                                                    |
| --------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| **docker/scout-cli**                          | Uses Docker Scout CLI in a container | No need to install Scout separately                        |

#### üîπ Pipeline Stages Explained

| Stage             | Purpose                  | Key Components                                 |
| ----------------- | ------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------- |
| **Source**        | Pull code from GitHub    | CodeStar Connection, GitHub repository         |
| **Build**         | Build Docker image       | Docker Build Cloud, Buildx, ARM64 optimization |
| **Security Scan** | Scan for vulnerabilities | Docker Scout, Security gates, Recommendations  |
| **Deploy**        | Deploy to ECS            | Amazon ECS, Container deployment               |

## üí° How Docker Technologies Integrate

The pipeline seamlessly integrates Docker technologies:

1. **Docker Build Cloud with Buildx**:

   - Optimizes build performance with distributed building
   - Supports ARM64 architecture for AWS Graviton compatibility
   - Streamlines the build and push process

2. **Docker Scout**:

   - Implements security gates to prevent vulnerable images from being deployed
   - Provides actionable recommendations for improving security
   - Generates detailed security reports for compliance and auditing

3. **Docker Hub**:
   - Securely stores container images
   - Provides version control through image tagging
   - Enables seamless deployment to Amazon ECS

## üîç Multi-Architecture Support

While our current pipeline is optimized specifically for ARM64 to match our ECS task definition, Docker Build Cloud's multi-architecture capabilities are worth highlighting:

### Why Multi-Architecture Matters

1. **AWS Graviton Support**: AWS offers ARM-based Graviton processors that provide better price-performance ratio
2. **Flexibility**: Your application can run on any ECS instance type without compatibility issues
3. **Future-Proofing**: As cloud providers continue to diversify CPU architectures, your containers remain compatible

### Enabling Multi-Architecture Builds

To enable multi-architecture builds in your own projects, you would modify the build command to:

```
docker buildx build --platform linux/amd64,linux/arm64 -t yourusername/yourapp:latest --push .
```

This creates a multi-architecture manifest that automatically serves the right image architecture based on the runtime environment.

## üöÄ Next Steps

Now that you understand how the pipeline is configured, let's complete the workshop by:

1. Making a change to the application
2. Triggering the pipeline
3. Observing the build, security scan, and deployment process

In the next section, we'll make a personalized change to the application and watch our complete CI/CD pipeline in action!
