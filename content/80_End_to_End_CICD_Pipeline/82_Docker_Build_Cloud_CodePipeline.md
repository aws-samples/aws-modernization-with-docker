# üîÑ Docker Build Cloud ‚Äì CodePipeline Perspective

Now that we've set up **Docker Build Cloud**, let's integrate it into a **CI/CD pipeline** using **AWS CodePipeline** and **AWS CodeBuild**.  

This section will:  
‚úÖ **Automating builds** using AWS CodeBuild  
‚úÖ **Set up AWS CodePipeline** to manage builds and deployments  

---

## **1Ô∏è‚É£ Understanding `buildspec.yml`**

Run this command below to create your buildspec file.

```bash
cat <<EOF > buildspec.yml
version: 0.2

env:
  secrets-manager:
    DOCKER_USERNAME: "dockerhub-credentials:DOCKER_USERNAME"
    DOCKER_TOKEN: "dockerhub-credentials:DOCKER_TOKEN"

phases:
  pre_build:
    commands:
      - echo Logging in to Docker Hub...
      - echo $DOCKER_TOKEN | docker login -u $DOCKER_USERNAME --password-stdin
      - echo Setting up Docker Buildx...
      - docker buildx create --name mybuilder --use
      - docker buildx inspect --bootstrap

  build:
    commands:
      - echo Building Docker image using BuildKit...
      - docker buildx build --platform linux/amd64,linux/arm64 -t $DOCKER_USERNAME/rent-a-room:latest --load .

artifacts:
  files:
    - '**/*'
EOF
```

The **`buildspec.yml`** file is a **YAML configuration file** that tells **AWS CodeBuild** what steps to take during a build. It includes:

‚úÖ **Environment setup** (e.g., Secrets Manager for credentials)  
‚úÖ **Pre-Build commands** (Logging into Docker Hub, setting up BuildKit)  
‚úÖ **Build commands** (Building the Docker image but not pushing it)  
‚úÖ **Artifacts** (Files that CodePipeline should store after the build)  

---

### **üîπ Key Sections in `buildspec.yml`**
Each `buildspec.yml` file follows this structure:

| Section | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| `version` | Specifies the buildspec format version (use `0.2`). |
| `env` | Defines environment variables (e.g., **AWS Secrets Manager credentials**). |
| `phases.pre_build` | Commands to run **before** building the application (e.g., **log into Docker Hub**). |
| `phases.build` | Commands to **compile and package** the application (e.g., **build the Docker image**). |
| `artifacts` | Defines which files should be **saved** after the build (e.g., `imagedefinitions.json` for ECS). |

---

### **üìÑ `buildspec.yml` Explained**
Now, let's walk through the **actual `buildspec.yml` file** step by step.

#### **1Ô∏è‚É£ Version & Environment Variables**
```yaml
version: 0.2
env:
  secrets-manager:
    DOCKER_USERNAME: "dockerhub-credentials:DOCKER_USERNAME"
    DOCKER_TOKEN: "dockerhub-credentials:DOCKER_TOKEN"
```
üîπ **What's happening?**  
- We use **version 0.2** (latest format).  
- AWS **Secrets Manager** dynamically injects **Docker Hub credentials** so they don't appear in plaintext.

---

#### **2Ô∏è‚É£ Pre-Build Phase**
```yaml
phases:
  pre_build:
    commands:
      - echo Logging in to Docker Hub...
      - echo $DOCKER_TOKEN | docker login -u $DOCKER_USERNAME --password-stdin
      - echo Setting up Docker Buildx...
      - docker buildx create --name mybuilder --use
      - docker buildx inspect --bootstrap
```
üîπ **What's happening?**  
‚úÖ **Authenticate to Docker Hub** using **AWS Secrets Manager**.  
‚úÖ **Enable BuildKit** to allow **faster, more efficient Docker builds**.  

---

#### **3Ô∏è‚É£ Build Phase**
```yaml
  build:
    commands:
      - echo Building Docker image using BuildKit...
      - docker buildx build --platform linux/amd64,linux/arm64 -t $DOCKER_USERNAME/rent-a-room:latest --load .
```
üîπ **What's happening?**  
‚úÖ Uses **Docker Buildx** to create **multi-platform images**.  
‚úÖ **Does NOT push** the image (pushing happens in **Docker Hub section**).  

---

#### **4Ô∏è‚É£ Artifacts**
```yaml
artifacts:
  files:
    - '**/*'
```
üîπ **What's happening?**  
‚úÖ Saves all build files in the **artifact store** (useful for later steps).  

---

## **2Ô∏è‚É£ Understanding `pipeline.yml`**
The **`pipeline.yml`** file defines the **AWS CodePipeline configuration** to automate the **CI/CD workflow**. Unlike a CloudFormation template, this file uses the direct pipeline format which can be used with the AWS CLI to create or update a pipeline.

‚úÖ **Defines pipeline stages** (Source, Build, Deploy)  
‚úÖ **Uses GitHub as the source repository**  
‚úÖ **Triggers AWS CodeBuild for Docker image builds**  

Here is the complete **`pipeline.yml`** in direct pipeline format:

```yaml
pipeline:
  roleArn: arn:aws:iam::account-id:role/CodePipelineServiceRole
  stages:
    - name: Source
      actions:
        - name: GitHubSource
          actionTypeId:
            category: Source
            owner: ThirdParty
            provider: GitHub
            version: '1'
          configuration:
            Owner: GitHubOwner
            Repo: GitHubRepo
            Branch: main
            OAuthToken: '{{resolve:secretsmanager:GitHub/WorkshopOwnerToken:SecretString:OwnerToken}}'
          outputArtifacts:
            - name: SourceArtifact
          runOrder: 1
    
    - name: Build
      actions:
        - name: BuildDockerImage
          actionTypeId:
            category: Build
            owner: AWS
            provider: CodeBuild
            version: '1'
          configuration:
            ProjectName: docker-build-cloud-project
          inputArtifacts:
            - name: SourceArtifact
          outputArtifacts:
            - name: BuildOutput
          runOrder: 1
  
  artifactStore:
    type: S3
    location: codepipeline-artifact-bucket
  name: docker-build-cloud-pipeline
  version: 1
```

This format can be used with AWS CLI to create a pipeline with this command `aws codepipeline create-pipeline --cli-input-yaml file://pipeline.yml` but we are not going to create the pipeline just yet!

---

### **üîπ Key Sections in `pipeline.yml`**
The direct pipeline format follows this structure:

| Section | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| `pipeline` | The root element that contains the entire pipeline definition. |
| `roleArn` | The IAM role that CodePipeline will use to execute the pipeline. |
| `stages` | An array of pipeline stages (e.g., Source, Build, Deploy). |
| `artifactStore` | Defines the S3 bucket where CodePipeline stores artifacts. |
| `name` | The name of your pipeline. |
| `version` | The version of the pipeline (usually 1). |

---

### **üìÑ `pipeline.yml` Explained**
Now, let's walk through the **actual `pipeline.yml` file** step by step.

#### **1Ô∏è‚É£ Source Stage**
```yaml
- name: Source
  actions:
    - name: GitHubSource
      actionTypeId:
        category: Source
        owner: ThirdParty
        provider: GitHub
        version: '1'
      configuration:
        Owner: GitHubOwner
        Repo: GitHubRepo
        Branch: main
        OAuthToken: '{{resolve:secretsmanager:GitHub/WorkshopOwnerToken:SecretString:OwnerToken}}'
      outputArtifacts:
        - name: SourceArtifact
      runOrder: 1
```
üîπ **What's happening?**

‚úÖ Pulls the **latest source code** from GitHub.  
‚úÖ Uses **AWS Secrets Manager** to retrieve the **GitHub OAuth Token** securely.  
‚úÖ Specifies the GitHub repository owner and repository name.  
‚úÖ Targets the 'main' branch of the repository.  
‚úÖ Outputs the source code as an artifact named **SourceArtifact** for later stages.

---

#### **2Ô∏è‚É£ Build Stage**
```yaml
- name: Build
  actions:
    - name: BuildDockerImage
      actionTypeId:
        category: Build
        owner: AWS
        provider: CodeBuild
        version: '1'
      configuration:
        ProjectName: docker-build-cloud-project
      inputArtifacts:
        - name: SourceArtifact
      outputArtifacts:
        - name: BuildOutput
      runOrder: 1
```
üîπ **What's happening?**  

‚úÖ Runs AWS CodeBuild to execute the buildspec.yml file in the source code.  
‚úÖ Uses the CodeBuild project named "docker-build-cloud-project" for the build process.  
‚úÖ Takes the **SourceArtifact** from the previous stage as input.  
‚úÖ Builds the Docker image based on instructions in the buildspec, but does not push it yet.  
‚úÖ Prepares the Docker image for later stages (like pushing to DockerHub or scanning with Docker Scout).  
‚úÖ Saves the build output as **BuildOutput** artifact.

---

#### **3Ô∏è‚É£ ArtifactStore & Pipeline Properties**
```yaml
artifactStore:
  type: S3
  location: codepipeline-artifact-bucket
name: docker-build-cloud-pipeline
version: 1
```
üîπ **What's happening?**  

‚úÖ Specifies an S3 bucket named "codepipeline-artifact-bucket" to store all pipeline artifacts.  
‚úÖ Names the pipeline "docker-build-cloud-pipeline".  
‚úÖ Sets the pipeline version to 1.

---

## **‚úÖ Next Steps**

**In the next section (`Docker Hub`), we will push the built image to our DockerHub Repository.**  

üöÄ Once this is done, you'll be a few stages away from a full **Docker Build Cloud CI/CD pipeline** set up in **AWS CodePipeline**.
