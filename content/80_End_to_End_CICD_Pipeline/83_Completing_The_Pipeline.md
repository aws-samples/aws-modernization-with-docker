# üèÅ Completing the End-to-End CI/CD Pipeline

Congratulations! You've successfully set up the AWS CodePipeline infrastructure with CloudFormation. Now let's make it come alive by triggering the pipeline and watching the entire workflow in action.

## üöÄ The Power of GitOps and DevOps with AWS and Docker

Before we start making changes to our application, let's understand why CI/CD pipelines are so valuable in modern software development:

### GitOps: Infrastructure as Code

GitOps is a set of practices that uses Git as the single source of truth for infrastructure and application code. With GitOps:

- All changes are made through pull requests
- Git provides audit history and rollback capabilities
- Infrastructure changes are declarative and version-controlled
- Automated systems ensure the deployed state matches the desired state

### DevOps: Breaking Down Silos

DevOps brings together development and operations teams to deliver software faster and more reliably:

- Shared responsibility for application quality
- Automated testing and deployment
- Continuous feedback loops
- Focus on small, incremental improvements

### Better Together: AWS and Docker

By combining AWS and Docker technologies in our CI/CD pipeline, we get the best of both worlds:

- Docker's containerization simplifies application packaging and deployment
- AWS's managed services provide scalable, reliable infrastructure
- Docker Build Cloud enables efficient multi-architecture builds
- Docker Scout ensures container security is built into the pipeline
- AWS CodePipeline orchestrates the entire workflow

## üíª Triggering the Pipeline with Team-Based Iterations

In real-world scenarios, different teams often work on different parts of an application. Let's simulate this by making changes to our Rent-A-Room application in two separate iterations, each focusing on a different component.

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Iteration 1: Home Page Team's Update

Imagine you're on the Home Page team, responsible for the landing page experience. Your team has received feedback that the current home page is too basic and doesn't effectively communicate the value proposition of the Rent-A-Room service. After a design sprint, your team has decided to implement a modern, visually appealing home page with the following improvements:

- A hero section with a clear value proposition
- Feature cards highlighting key benefits
- Improved call-to-action buttons
- Responsive design for mobile users

As the lead developer on the Home Page team, you've been tasked with implementing these changes and deploying them through the CI/CD pipeline. Here's how you would make these updates:

```bash
cd /workshop/Rent-A-Room && \
echo 'import React, { useState, useEffect } from "react";
import { Link } from "react-router-dom";
import BannerImage from "../../images/choosinghouse.svg";
import "./home.css";

const Home = () => {
  return (
    <div className="home-container">
      <div className="hero-section">
        <div className="hero-content">
          <h1 className="hero-title">Find Your Perfect Stay</h1>
          <p className="hero-subtitle">
            Discover unique spaces that feel just like home
          </p>
          <Link to="/rooms">
            <button className="cta-button">
              Explore Rooms
              <span className="arrow">‚Üí</span>
            </button>
          </Link>
        </div>
        <div className="hero-image">
          <img src={BannerImage} alt="Room illustration" />
        </div>
      </div>
      <div className="features-section">
        <div className="feature-card">
          <div className="feature-icon">üè†</div>
          <h3>Verified Homes</h3>
          <p>All our properties are carefully vetted for quality</p>

        </div>
        <div className="feature-card">
          <div className="feature-icon">üîí</div>
          <h3>Secure Booking</h3>
          <p>Your safety and security is our top priority</p>
        </div>
      </div>
    </div>
  );

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Monitor First Iteration Pipeline Execution

After pushing your changes, navigate to the AWS CodePipeline console to watch your pipeline execute:

```bash
https://console.aws.amazon.com/codepipeline/home
```

You'll see the pipeline progress through the Source, Build, Security Scan, and Deploy stages. This demonstrates how changes from the Home Page team flow through the pipeline independently.

![pipeline-execution-home](/images/pipeline-execution.png)

Once completed, you can verify the changes by accessing your application URL:

```bash
# Get the task URL (public IP of the ECS task)
TASK_ARN=$(aws ecs list-tasks --cluster rent-a-room-cluster --service-name rent-a-room-service --query 'taskArns[0]' --output text)
TASK_DETAILS=$(aws ecs describe-tasks --cluster rent-a-room-cluster --tasks $TASK_ARN)
ENI_ID=$(echo $TASK_DETAILS | jq -r '.tasks[0].attachments[0].details[] | select(.name=="networkInterfaceId").value')
PUBLIC_IP=$(aws ec2 describe-network-interfaces --network-interface-ids $ENI_ID --query 'NetworkInterfaces[0].Association.PublicIp' --output text)

echo "‚úÖ Application URL: http://$PUBLIC_IP"
echo "Note: Your browser may show a security warning since we're using HTTP. Click 'Advanced' and 'Continue' to proceed."
```

### üì∏ Home Page Transformation

Let's see the impact of the Home Page team's changes:

![Home Page Before](/images/docker-frontend-built-cropped.png)
_Before: Basic home page with minimal styling and features_

![Home Page After](/images/home-after.png)
_After: Enhanced home page with modern design and feature cards_

The Home Page team has successfully transformed the landing page experience, creating a more engaging and informative entry point for users.

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Iteration 2: Room Listings Team's Update

Now imagine you're on the Room Listings team, responsible for the room browsing and discovery experience. Your team has been analyzing user behavior data and has identified several pain points in the current room listings page:

- Users can't easily compare different rooms
- There are no images to help users visualize the spaces
- Important details like amenities are missing
- The search functionality is limited
- The overall design lacks visual appeal

After conducting user interviews and A/B testing, your team has designed a new room listings experience with:

- A card-based layout for easy scanning and comparison
- High-quality images for each property
- Prominent pricing information
- Amenity tags to highlight features
- An improved search interface
- Hover effects and animations for better engagement

As a full-stack developer on the Room Listings team, you're implementing these changes independently from the Home Page team's work. The modular architecture and CI/CD pipeline allow both teams to work in parallel without conflicts:

```bash
cd /workshop/Rent-A-Room && \
echo 'import { useState } from "react";
import "./roomslist.css";

function RoomsList() {
    const [rooms] = useState([

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Monitor Second Iteration Pipeline Execution

After pushing your second set of changes, return to the AWS CodePipeline console to watch your pipeline execute again:

```bash
https://console.aws.amazon.com/codepipeline/home
```

![pipeline-execution-rooms](/images/pipeline-execution.png)

This demonstrates how the Room Listings team can make changes independently of the Home Page team, with both sets of changes flowing through the same pipeline.

Once the pipeline completes, verify the updated room listings by accessing your application URL again:

```bash
echo "‚úÖ Application URL: http://$PUBLIC_IP/rooms"
```

## üö¢ Verifying ECS Deployment

After the pipeline completes, verify your application is running on Amazon ECS:

```bash
# Get the task URL (public IP of the ECS task)
TASK_ARN=$(aws ecs list-tasks --cluster rent-a-room-cluster --service-name rent-a-room-service --query 'taskArns[0]' --output text)
TASK_DETAILS=$(aws ecs describe-tasks --cluster rent-a-room-cluster --tasks $TASK_ARN)
ENI_ID=$(echo $TASK_DETAILS | jq -r '.tasks[0].attachments[0].details[] | select(.name=="networkInterfaceId").value')
PUBLIC_IP=$(aws ec2 describe-network-interfaces --network-interface-ids $ENI_ID --query 'NetworkInterfaces[0].Association.PublicIp' --output text)

# Check if we got a valid IP
if [ -n "$PUBLIC_IP" ] && [ "$PUBLIC_IP" != "None" ]; then
  echo "‚úÖ Application URL: http://$PUBLIC_IP"
  echo "Note: Your browser may show a security warning since we're using HTTP. Click 'Advanced' and 'Continue' to proceed."
else
  echo "‚ö†Ô∏è Could not retrieve task public IP. Using task details instead."
  # Alternative approach: Get the task details and print them
  TASK_ID=$(echo $TASK_ARN | awk -F'/' '{print $NF}')
  echo "Task ID: $TASK_ID"
  echo "Check the task details in the AWS Console: https://console.aws.amazon.com/ecs/home?region=us-east-1#/clusters/rent-a-room-cluster/tasks/$TASK_ID/details"
fi
```

Visit the application URL to see your deployed application with the enhanced UI from both teams!

### üì∏ Room Listings Transformation

Let's see the impact of the Room Listings team's changes:

![Rooms Page Before](/images/rooms-before.png)
_Before: Simple list of rooms with basic information_

![Rooms Page After](/images/rooms-after.png)
_After: Modern card-based design with images, amenity tags, and improved visual hierarchy_

The Room Listings team has successfully transformed the browsing experience, making it easier for users to find and compare rooms that meet their needs.

### üõ°Ô∏è Optional: Security Gates with Docker Scout

In our pipeline, we've already implemented Docker Scout security scanning, but let's explore how it's acting as a security gate to prevent vulnerable images from being deployed to production.

The current CodeBuild project for Docker Scout includes this important configuration:

```yaml
build:
  commands:
    - echo Running Docker Scout security scan using container image...
    - docker pull $DOCKER_USERNAME/rent-a-room:$IMAGE_TAG
    # Run Docker Scout with security gates
    - >
      docker run --rm 
      -e DOCKER_SCOUT_HUB_USER=$DOCKER_USERNAME 
      -e DOCKER_SCOUT_HUB_PASSWORD=$DOCKER_TOKEN 
      docker/scout-cli cves $DOCKER_USERNAME/rent-a-room:$IMAGE_TAG --exit-code --only-severity critical,high
    - echo "No critical or high vulnerabilities found. Scan passed!"
```

The key parameter is `--exit-code --only-severity critical,high`, which causes the command to:

1. Return exit code (failure) if vulnerabilities are found
2. Only consider critical and high severity vulnerabilities

This is a security gate that prevents images with serious vulnerabilities from proceeding through the pipeline to deployment.

#### Testing the Security Gate

To see how this security gate works in practice, you could use the vulnerable Dockerfile we created earlier in the Docker Scout section:

```bash
# Navigate to your repository
cd /workshop/Rent-A-Room

# Test the security gate locally
docker scout cves $DOCKER_USERNAME/rent-a-room:vulnerable --exit-code --only-severity critical,high
```

This command will likely fail if it was ran through the pipeline with a non-zero exit code due to the vulnerabilities in the older Node.js and Nginx versions used in the vulnerable Dockerfile.

If you were to modify your pipeline to deploy this vulnerable image, the security scan stage would fail, preventing the vulnerable image from being deployed to your ECS cluster.

#### Customizing Security Gates

You can customize the security gates based on your organization's risk tolerance:

- `--only-severity critical` - Only fail on critical vulnerabilities
- `--only-severity critical,high` - Fail on critical and high vulnerabilities
- `--only-severity critical,high,medium` - Stricter policy that fails on medium vulnerabilities too

By implementing security gates, you ensure that security is an integral part of your CI/CD process, not just an afterthought.

Docker Scout provides security scanning as part of the CI/CD pipeline, ensuring that vulnerabilities are caught before deployment. The security report is stored as an artifact in the pipeline, allowing you to review it at any time.

## üîç Integrating with Docker Scout using Security Gate

You could run the following command to update the `docker-workshop-pipeline` stack with the integration of Docker Scout Security Gate.

```bash
# Download the new CloudFormation template with Docker Scout
curl -s -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aws-samples/aws-modernization-with-docker/main/static/infrastructure/ecs-pipeline-setup-with-docker-scout.yaml -o ecs-pipeline-setup-with-docker-scout.yaml || { echo "Failed to download template"; exit 1; }

# Verify the template was downloaded correctly
if [ -s ecs-pipeline-setup-with-docker-scout.yaml ]; then
  echo "‚úÖ Template downloaded successfully. Verifying content..."
  grep -q "AWSTemplateFormatVersion" ecs-pipeline-setup-with-docker-scout.yaml && echo "‚úÖ Template validation passed" || echo "‚ùå Template validation failed"
else
  echo "‚ùå Template download failed or file is empty"
  exit 1
fi

# Check if Docker Hub credentials already exist in Secrets Manager
echo "Checking existing Docker Hub credentials in Secrets Manager..."
if aws secretsmanager describe-secret --secret-id dockerhub-credentials &>/dev/null; then
  echo "‚úÖ Using existing Docker Hub credentials from Secrets Manager"
  # Get the Docker username from the existing secret for the stack update
  DOCKER_USERNAME=$(aws secretsmanager get-secret-value --secret-id dockerhub-credentials --query 'SecretString' --output text | jq -r '.DOCKER_USERNAME')
else
  echo "‚ùå Docker Hub credentials not found in Secrets Manager. Please create them first."
  exit 1
fi

# Deploy the CloudFormation stack with Docker Scout
echo "Updating CloudFormation stack with Docker Scout integration..."
aws cloudformation deploy \
  --template-file ecs-pipeline-setup-with-docker-scout.yaml \
  --stack-name docker-workshop-pipeline \
  --parameter-overrides \
    GitHubOwner=$GITHUB_USERNAME \
    GitHubRepo=$GITHUB_REPO \
    GitHubBranch=$GITHUB_BRANCH \
    CodeStarConnectionArn=$CONNECTION_ARN \
    DockerHubUsername=$DOCKER_USERNAME \
    DockerHubOrganization=${DOCKER_ORGANIZATION:-$DOCKER_USERNAME} \
  --capabilities CAPABILITY_IAM CAPABILITY_NAMED_IAM \
  --no-fail-on-empty-changeset

# Check the deployment status
echo "Checking deployment status..."
STATUS=$(aws cloudformation describe-stacks --stack-name docker-workshop-pipeline --query "Stacks[0].StackStatus" --output text)
echo "Stack status: $STATUS"

if [ "$STATUS" == "CREATE_COMPLETE" ] || [ "$STATUS" == "UPDATE_COMPLETE" ]; then
  echo "‚úÖ Stack update successful!"

  # Get the pipeline URL and other relevant outputs
  PIPELINE_URL=$(aws cloudformation describe-stacks --stack-name docker-workshop-pipeline --query "Stacks[0].Outputs[?OutputKey=='PipelineURL'].OutputValue" --output text)
  echo "üîó Pipeline URL: $PIPELINE_URL"

  # Get Docker Scout specific outputs if available
  SCOUT_URL=$(aws cloudformation describe-stacks --stack-name docker-workshop-pipeline --query "Stacks[0].Outputs[?OutputKey=='DockerScoutDashboardURL'].OutputValue" --output text)
  if [ ! -z "$SCOUT_URL" ]; then
    echo "üîç Docker Scout Dashboard URL: $SCOUT_URL"
  fi
else
  echo "‚ö†Ô∏è Deployment status: $STATUS - Check the AWS Console for more details"
fi
```

Once the CloudFormation stack is updated, run the following command to make a small change to trigger a build in the CodePipeline:

```bash
# change directory into the repo folder
cd /workshop/Rent-A-Room

# Make a small change to force a rebuild
echo "// Small change" >> src/App.js

# git updates
git add src/App.js
git commit -m "small change"
git push
```

Once the code pipeline reaches the **Security Scan** stage, examine the failed build:

![cicdpipeline-scout-security-gate](/images/cicdpipeline-scout-security-gate.png)

The pipeline is configured to generate a security report using Docker Scout:

```bash
# Find the artifact bucket with the correct prefix
ARTIFACT_BUCKET=$(aws s3 ls | grep docker-workshop-pipeline-artifactbucket | head -1 | awk '{print $3}')

# Get the most recent artifact ID
LATEST_ARTIFACT=$(aws s3 ls s3://$ARTIFACT_BUCKET/docker-workshop-pipe/SecuritySc/ | sort -k1,2 | tail -1 | awk '{print $4}')

# Create a temporary directory for extraction
mkdir -p scout-extract
cd scout-extract

# Download the artifact with the correct file extension
echo "Downloading security scan artifact: $LATEST_ARTIFACT"
aws s3 cp s3://$ARTIFACT_BUCKET/docker-workshop-pipe/SecuritySc/$LATEST_ARTIFACT ./artifact.zip

# Extract the artifact
echo "Attempting to extract the artifact..."
unzip -B artifact.zip

# Display the security report if it exists
if [ -f security-report.json ]; then
  echo "Security scan results:"
  cat security-report.json | jq
else
  echo "Could not extract security-report.json."
  ls -la
fi

# Return to the original directory
cd ..
```

You can also view the results directly in the Docker Scout dashboard:

1. Navigate to the Docker Scout dashboard: https://scout.docker.com/
2. Find your `rent-a-room` repository
3. Review the security scan results:
   - Vulnerability summary
   - Package details
   - Recommended fixes

## üè¢ Real-World Benefits of GitOps and DevOps

The approach we've demonstrated offers numerous benefits for real-world development teams:

### 1. Team Autonomy

Different teams can work on different parts of the application without stepping on each other's toes. The Home Page team and Room Listings team were able to make changes independently.

### 2. Continuous Integration

Each change is automatically built, tested, and deployed, ensuring that integration issues are caught early.

### 3. Deployment Consistency

The same pipeline is used for all changes, ensuring that every deployment follows the same process and meets the same quality standards.

### 4. Security by Default

Docker Scout automatically scans images for vulnerabilities, making security an integral part of the development process.

### 5. Rapid Feedback

Teams get immediate feedback on their changes, allowing them to iterate quickly and respond to user needs.

## üéÆ Interactive Challenge: Customize Your App Further

Now that you understand how the CI/CD pipeline works, try one of these fun customizations:

1. **Change the Color Scheme**: Modify the CSS to use your favorite colors
2. **Add a New Room**: Add another room listing with a unique description
3. **Update the Logo**: Change the navbar brand from "Rent A Room" to something creative

Make your changes, commit them, and watch the pipeline automatically deploy your customized version!

## üîÑ The Power of Integration: AWS and Docker

This pipeline demonstrates the seamless integration between AWS and Docker technologies:
