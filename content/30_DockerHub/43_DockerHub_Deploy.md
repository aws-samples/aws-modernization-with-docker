# ðŸš€ Next Steps

Now that you've set up Docker Hub authentication and stored your credentials securely, you're ready to proceed with building Docker images.

## Choose Your Docker Build Path

You have two options for building Docker images:

### Option 1: Docker Build Local
The traditional approach using your local machine's resources.
- Free to use
- Works offline
- No subscription required

[Continue with Docker Build Local â†’](../../35_Docker_Build_Local/)

### Option 2: Docker Build Cloud
The cloud-based approach for faster builds.
- Accelerated build times
- Reduced local resource usage
- Requires Docker Pro/Team/Business subscription

[Continue with Docker Build Cloud â†’](../../36_Docker_Build_Cloud/)

## What You'll Learn Next

Regardless of which path you choose, you'll learn how to:

- Create Dockerfiles for multi-stage builds
- Build optimized container images
- Run and test containerized applications
- Implement caching strategies for faster builds
- Push images to Docker Hub

## Later in the Workshop

After completing the Docker build sections, you'll continue with:

- AWS CodePipeline integration
- Docker Scout for security scanning
- ECS deployment
- End-to-end CI/CD pipeline setup

Choose your preferred Docker build method to continue!
