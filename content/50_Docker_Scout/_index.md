# 🔍 Docker Scout – Introduction

## **📌 What is Docker Scout?**

[Docker Scout](https://docs.docker.com/scout/) is a **container security tool** that helps developers:

- ✅ **Scan** container images for **vulnerabilities**.
- ✅ **Identify** outdated dependencies and security risks.
- ✅ **Get remediation guidance** to fix security issues.
- ✅ **Automate** vulnerability scanning within **CI/CD pipelines**.

By using Docker Scout, we ensure that **only secure images** are pushed and deployed.

## **📌 Why Use Docker Scout?**

| Feature                    | Benefit                                                                     |
| -------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Vulnerability Scanning** | Identifies CVEs (Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures) in container images. |
| **Remediation Guidance**   | Provides recommended fixes for security issues.                             |
| **Policy Enforcement**     | Blocks deployment of insecure images.                                       |
| **CI/CD Integration**      | Automates security checks in AWS CodePipeline.                              |

## **📌 What We'll Cover in This Section**

In this section, we'll:

1. **Create a vulnerable Dockerfile** with known security issues
2. **Scan the image** using Docker Scout to identify vulnerabilities
3. **Fix the vulnerabilities** by updating base images and packages
4. **Integrate Docker Scout** into an AWS CodePipeline to automate security checks

This hands-on approach will demonstrate how Docker Scout can be used to identify security issues in your container images before they reach production.
