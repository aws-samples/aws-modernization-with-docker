# üîß Fixing Vulnerabilities in Docker Images

Now that we have scanned our vulnerable image with **Docker Scout**, let's **fix** the identified security issues.

---

## **1Ô∏è‚É£ Analyzing the Vulnerable Dockerfile**
Let's examine the vulnerabilities in our `Dockerfile.vulnerable`:

```dockerfile
# Build stage
# Using Node.js 12.22.0 which has CVE-2021-22883 (OpenSSL vulnerabilities)
FROM node:12.22.0-alpine as build 

# Production stage
# Using Nginx 1.14.0 which has CVE-2019-9516 (HTTP/2 DoS vulnerability)
FROM nginx:1.14.0-alpine

# Install additional packages - using a vulnerable version of curl
# CVE-2018-1000120 in curl 7.60.0
RUN apk add --no-cache curl openssl
```

Docker Scout identified several vulnerabilities:
- **Node.js 12.22.0**: Contains OpenSSL vulnerabilities (CVE-2021-22883)
- **Nginx 1.14.0**: Contains HTTP/2 DoS vulnerability (CVE-2019-9516)
- **curl**: Contains vulnerability CVE-2018-1000120

---

## **2Ô∏è‚É£ Creating a Fixed Dockerfile**
Let's create a fixed version of our Dockerfile:

```bash
cat << 'EOF' > Dockerfile.fixed
# Build stage
# Updated to Node.js 20 (latest LTS) to fix vulnerabilities
FROM node:20-alpine as build 
WORKDIR /app
ENV DISABLE_ESLINT_PLUGIN=true

# Copy package files and install dependencies
COPY package*.json ./
RUN npm install --no-package-lock

# Copy the rest of the application code
COPY . .
RUN npm run build

# Production stage
# Using a more recent Alpine version with fewer vulnerabilities
FROM nginx:stable-alpine

# Copy the build output to replace the default nginx contents
COPY --from=build /app/build /usr/share/nginx/html

# Copy nginx configuration
COPY nginx.conf /etc/nginx/conf.d/default.conf

# Update packages before installing to get latest security patches
RUN apk update && \
    apk upgrade && \
    apk add --no-cache curl openssl

# Expose port
EXPOSE 80

# Start nginx with non-root user for better security
# Create a non-root user to run nginx
RUN adduser -D -H -u 1000 -s /sbin/nologin nginx-user && \
    chown -R nginx-user:nginx-user /var/cache/nginx /etc/nginx/conf.d

USER nginx-user

CMD ["nginx", "-g", "daemon off;"]
EOF
```

Key fixes:
- Updated Node.js from 12.22.0 to 20 (latest LTS)
- Updated Nginx from 1.14.0 to 1.25 with Alpine 3.18 (more recent base)
- Using `apk update && apk upgrade` to ensure all packages are updated to latest available versions
- Added security hardening by running nginx as a non-root user

## **3Ô∏è‚É£ Build and Scan the Fixed Image**
Build the image using the fixed Dockerfile:

```bash
docker build -t fixed-app:latest -f Dockerfile.fixed .
```

Run another **Docker Scout scan** to confirm our major issues are fixed:

```bash
docker scout cves fixed-app:latest
```

You may still see some vulnerabilities in the scan results. This is common in container security - even the latest available packages in a repository might have known vulnerabilities that haven't been patched yet.

### **Understanding Remaining Vulnerabilities**

Even in our "fixed" image, you might see vulnerabilities in:

- **expat**: A dependency of the nginx Alpine image
- **curl**: The latest available version in the Alpine repository
- **musl**: A core Alpine library
- **busybox**: A core Alpine utility package

These vulnerabilities represent the reality of container security - there's often a balance between:
1. Using the latest available packages
2. Waiting for security patches to be available in the repository
3. Accepting some level of risk for non-critical vulnerabilities

---

## **4Ô∏è‚É£ Compare the Results**
Let's compare the vulnerability scan results between the vulnerable and fixed images:

```bash
docker scout compare vulnerable-app:latest --to fixed-app:latest
```

This will show you a side-by-side comparison of vulnerabilities that were remediated.

## **5Ô∏è‚É£ Risk Assessment and Mitigation Strategies**

When dealing with remaining vulnerabilities, consider these strategies:

1. **Assess the severity and exploitability** - Critical vulnerabilities in exposed packages need immediate attention
2. **Use vulnerability suppression** - For vulnerabilities you've assessed as low risk
3. **Consider alternative base images** - Some distributions patch vulnerabilities faster than others
4. **Implement defense in depth** - Use network policies, runtime protection, and least privilege principles

## **6Ô∏è‚É£ Best Practices for Secure Dockerfiles**

| Best Practice | Description |
|---------------|-------------|
| **Use Official Images** | Always use official Docker images as base images |
| **Use Specific Tags** | Avoid using `latest` tag; use specific version tags |
| **Keep Base Images Updated** | Regularly update base images to include security patches |
| **Minimize Image Layers** | Combine RUN commands to reduce layers and attack surface |
| **Use Multi-stage Builds** | Separate build and runtime environments |
| **Specify Package Versions** | Pin package versions to avoid unexpected updates |
| **Scan Images Regularly** | Integrate Docker Scout into your CI/CD pipeline |

Now that our image is secure, let's **automate vulnerability scanning** in **AWS CodePipeline**!
