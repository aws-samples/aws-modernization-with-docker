# üîç Scanning Docker Images with Docker Scout

Now that we understand what **Docker Scout** is, let's **scan our Docker images** for security vulnerabilities.

---

## **1Ô∏è‚É£ Install Docker Scout**

Ensure Docker Scout is installed by running:

```bash
docker scout version
```

If it's not installed, update Docker to the latest version or manually install it:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/docker/scout-cli/main/install.sh -o install-scout.sh
sh install-scout.sh
```

---

## **2Ô∏è‚É£ Create a Vulnerable Dockerfile for Testing**

Let's create a Dockerfile with known vulnerabilities to demonstrate Docker Scout's capabilities:

```bash
cat << 'EOF' > Dockerfile.vulnerable
# Build stage
# Using Node.js 12.22.0 which has CVE-2021-22883 (OpenSSL vulnerabilities)
FROM node:12.22.0-alpine as build
WORKDIR /app
ENV DISABLE_ESLINT_PLUGIN=true

# Copy package files and install dependencies
COPY package*.json ./
RUN npm install --no-package-lock --legacy-peer-deps

# Copy the rest of the application code
COPY . .
RUN npm run build

# Production stage
# Using Nginx 1.14.0 which has CVE-2019-9516 (HTTP/2 DoS vulnerability)
FROM nginx:1.14.0-alpine

# Copy the build output to replace the default nginx contents
COPY --from=build /app/build /usr/share/nginx/html

# Copy nginx configuration
COPY nginx.conf /etc/nginx/conf.d/default.conf

# Install additional packages - using a vulnerable version of curl
# CVE-2018-1000120 in curl 7.60.0
RUN apk add --no-cache curl openssl

# Expose port
EXPOSE 80

# Start nginx
CMD ["nginx", "-g", "daemon off;"]
EOF
```

This Dockerfile intentionally uses:

- Node.js 12.22.0 with known OpenSSL vulnerabilities
- Nginx 1.14.0 with HTTP/2 DoS vulnerability
- A vulnerable version of curl

## **3Ô∏è‚É£ Build the Vulnerable Image**

Build the image using the vulnerable Dockerfile:

```bash
docker build -t vulnerable-app:latest -f Dockerfile.vulnerable .
```

---

## **4Ô∏è‚É£ Scan the Vulnerable Image with Docker Scout**

Now let's scan our vulnerable image:

```bash
docker scout quickview vulnerable-app:latest
```

üîπ This will display a **summary of vulnerabilities** in the image.  
üîπ To get a **detailed report**, run:

```bash
docker scout cves vulnerable-app:latest
```

**Example Output:**

![Scout](/images/Detailedscout.png)

üîπ Each outcome is a link to Docker Scout, click to see more

## **5Ô∏è‚É£ Understanding the Output**

| Column               | Description                                    |
| -------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| **CVE ID**           | The identifier of the vulnerability.           |
| **Severity**         | The risk level (Low, Medium, High, Critical).  |
| **Affected Package** | The component that contains the vulnerability. |
| **Remediation**      | Suggested upgrade or patch.                    |

---

## **6Ô∏è‚É£ Scan Our Application Image**

We can also scan the application image we built and pushed in the previous section:

```bash
docker scout quickview $DOCKER_USERNAME/rent-a-room:latest
docker scout cves $DOCKER_USERNAME/rent-a-room:latest
```

Compare the results between the vulnerable image and our application image.

---

## **üìå Next Steps**

Now that we've **identified vulnerabilities**, let's **remediate them** in our Dockerfile.  
Move to the **next section** to learn how to fix security issues. üöÄ
