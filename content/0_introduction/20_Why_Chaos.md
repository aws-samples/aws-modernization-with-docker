There are many reasons to perform chaos engineering. We see teams across the industry turn to this practice to reduce incidents, lower the cost of downtime, train their team and prepare for moments that matter. 

#### Reduce Incidents
By practicing chaos engineering you are able to detect issues before they become incidents and before your customers get affected. 

#### Cost of Downtime
The cost of downtime is very expensive, the average company loses $300,000/hour of downtime. The numbers get larger with the companies that operate at internet scale, and if it's during a high traffic event like a sale or launch.

#### Train your Team 
Give your team a chance to build their muscle memory. Run planned Chaos Engineering experiments to train your engineers on how to be on call and respond to incidents. 

#### Prepare for moments that matter
By working on the three points above your team will feel more confident everyday as they build their respective applications and systems. Less time will be spent fire fighthing and  more time building and creating value.
