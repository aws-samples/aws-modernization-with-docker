First, let's take a step back and start with it's definition. 

#### Definition:

"Thoughtful, planned experiments designed to reveal weakness in our systems."

But we can break this down a bit more.

If you look up the word Chaos in a dictionary, you’ll find at least two meanings:
First, the most known meaning of the word Chaos: “Complete disorder and confusion”.
However, if you look up the meaning that is used in the Physics community, it means:
“The property of a complex system whose behaviour is so unpredictable as to appear random, owing to great sensitivity to small changes in conditions.”

And that is exactly what we try to uncover when practicing Chaos Engineering: finding the changes in conditions that have great impact on the predictability and reliability of our applications.

We do that by carefully experimenting on our systems to reveal weaknesses, learn from them, fix them and verify them in an ongoing fashion.
