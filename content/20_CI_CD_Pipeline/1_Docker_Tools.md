### Docker Build Cloud
Docker Build Cloud is a service that lets you build your container images faster, both locally and in CI. Builds run on cloud infrastructure optimally dimensioned for your workloads, no configuration required. The service uses a remote build cache, ensuring fast builds anywhere and for all team members.

### Docker Scout
Docker Scout is a comprehensive security solution designed to address vulnerabilities in container images, which are composed of layers and software packages that can pose security risks to containers and applications. It enhances software supply chain security by analyzing images and creating a Software Bill of Materials (SBOM) - an inventory of all components. This SBOM is continuously checked against an updated vulnerability database to identify potential security weaknesses. Users can access Docker Scout through multiple interfaces, including Docker Desktop, Docker Hub, Docker CLI, and the Docker Scout Dashboard, while also leveraging its integration capabilities with third-party container registries and CI platforms.

### Docker Hub
Docker Hub is a robust container registry platform that streamlines development by providing extensive tools for storing, managing, and sharing Docker images. It offers developers access to pre-built images and assets to accelerate development workflows, while featuring seamless tool integration for enhanced productivity and reliable application deployment. The platform includes key features such as unlimited public repositories, private repositories, workflow automation through webhooks, integration with GitHub and Bitbucket, support for concurrent and automated builds, and a collection of trusted, secure content. This combination of features makes Docker Hub an essential resource for container-based development and deployment.

### Testcontainers
Testcontainers is a popular open source library designed to support integration testing by providing lightweight, disposable instances of common databases, web browsers, or any service that can run in a Docker container. It allows developers to write tests that interact with real instances of external resources, rather than relying on mocks or stubs.
